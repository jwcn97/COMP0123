Bands that are named after locations from which they do not originate.



The band, America, is actually from the UK. The band, I'm From Barcelona, is actually from Sweden. Of Montral is actually from Athens, Georgia USA.

The collection of bands named in such a manner form the edges of a directed graph.

I wish to explore the graph theoretical properties of this network. What is the largest connected component? Are there any cycles?

Data was initially collected back in 2007/2008 so it could use some updating.

# Network Analysis on a Unified Human Brain Connectome

*FINDINGS*<br/>
•	The optimal range of edge confidence to analyse the consensus connectome is 20% - 50%. A graph with confidence level lower than 20% would be too specific towards a few individuals and not be such a good representation of the whole subject pool. On the other hand, a graph with confidence level higher than 50% is too restrictive to derive any useful insights<br/>
•	At higher edge confidence level, the network is seen to resemble a power law network, exhibiting scale-free characteristics. At lower edge confidence level, the network is seen to favour a higher functional segregation and integration, exhibiting more small-world characteristics to facilitate quick information transfer
